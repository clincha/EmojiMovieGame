Hi Angus, I like your project idea, and believe you can present a suitable prototype by the end of the module.


You proposed to associate a sentiment (represented by an emoji) to a user-defined hashtag.

What you should think about for this project is:

The extraction of tweets. How will you extract tweets? In addition, you mentioned “filtered” tweets: what will be the criterion to filter said tweets? You mention later that you will select tweets in which the sentiment is easy to analyze. That is indeed a good starting point.

The sentiment analysis over the hashtags. You can indeed rely on MonkeyLearn.

The mapping of the sentiment to an emoji. This will be the challenging part of your project, once you will focus on a large set of tweets.

The visualisation


Don’t forget that your project should include an evaluation part. What will you evaluate? The ability of your system to match the sentiment of the tweets? The ability to give a proper visualization of the user’s mood? In any case, start from a small set of easy tweets first, and once it seems to do well enough, try to feed more and more tweets to the system.


Be aware that MonkeyLearn is not a free tool - however the free version should allow you to do what you want to do.



Hope that helps!

Good luck with the project, and feel free to contact me if you have any questions or need any help.


Best,

Sophie
