Hi!

Thanks for submitting your project proposal for the CO659 
Computational Creativity module. I think that the idea that you have 
suggested is fine and will make an appropriate project for the module.

You have identified three interesting papers and clearly identified 
how they are relevant to the project. You might want to look a little 
more broadly at some other computational creativity systems that are 
also based around sentiment analysis, e.g.

http://computationalcreativity.net/iccc2012/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/095-Colton.pdf

There are lots of sentiment analysis engines out there as web 
services and open source software. I have used this one successfully before:

https://www.meaningcloud.com/products/sentiment-analysis

it has a decent API and you can get a basic free account which should be 
enough for you to do your project work with. There is also something in 
the Stanford open-source NLP library see e.g. here:

https://blog.openshift.com/day-20-stanford-corenlp-performing-sentiment-analysis-of-twitter-using-java/
https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/sentiment.html

You need to think more about how you are going to evaluate the 
project. This is a mixture of both seeing whether a small sample of 
users agree with the success aims that you set out in the proposal - 
does it look different (to what?), do people want to use it - which will 
need some user testing. You should also evaluate the creativity of the 
system - I'll give some ideas for that in a future lecture.

Good wishes,

Colin
